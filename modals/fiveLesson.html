                        <p class="text">Hi everybody,</p>
                        <p class="text">I hope that all of you had a wonderful weekend, because I certainly did: first, after leaving work on Friday I decided that I was just sick and tired of wasting away my days sitting in traffic and so instead of getting on the 101 at 5pm like every other schlub I decided to wait out traffic and take a nice walk around the business park to see what I could see, and it turns out that while we all sit around plugging away at our computers all day we are missing out on a whole plethora of wonderful sights, sounds, and smells just around our very own parking lot; for example, it turns out that there is a crabapple tree about twenty feet past the light pole in the northwest corner of the lot, and not only that, there are tons of crabapples within arm’s length (granted, I have long arms), plus you can shake the trunk of the tree really hard and even more crabapples will fall down from the top; <b>also, by the way, the executive team met this weekend and decided that it’s going to be necessary to implement the layoff plan we mentioned last week</b>, but once that bit of business was finished we all went out for ice cream on account of the heat, but what we quickly found out was that the issue with ice cream is that you want it when it’s really hot, but unfortunately when it’s really hot the ice cream melts super fast, which sort of leaves you in a classic “catch-22” (by the way, it turns out that’s also the name of a book [go figure]) because you really want ice cream but you know that the moment you get it then you’re going to have a huge mess on your hands, which is only made worse when the ice cream store only has those super thin paper napkins that tear the moment you try to use them to clean up the mess! Anyway, let me know if you have any questions regarding the above.</p>
                        <p class="text">Happy Monday,</p>
